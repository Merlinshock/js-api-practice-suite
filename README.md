# js-api-practice-suite

A collection of small JavaScript projects demonstrating how to interact with public APIs using Axios. This suite includes three separate features: fetching fake user data, generating random dog images, and searching universities by country. It serves as a practical hands-on learning project for mastering API requests, async/await, DOM manipulation, and error handling in JavaScript.

## 📌 Features Overview

### 🔹 1. Fake User Information (RandomUser API)
Fetches a random fake user profile including:
- Name  
- Gender  
- Email  
- Address  
- Additional personal details  

The details are displayed in JSON format inside the webpage.

### 🔹 2. Random Dog Images (Dog CEO API)
Displays a random dog image with each button click.  
Uses Axios to retrieve image URLs and updates the DOM instantly.

### 🔹 3. College Finder by Country (Hipolabs Universities API)
Enter any country name to retrieve a list of universities.  
Useful for understanding:
- Query string API requests  
- Rendering dynamic lists  
- Handling API errors gracefully
